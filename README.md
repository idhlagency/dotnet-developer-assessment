# .NET Developer Assessment

## Overview

You are tasked with creating a blog post page using the [provided solution](./DeveloperAssessment.sln), which is a slightly modified version of the default ASP.NET Core MVC template targeting .NET 8.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Assessments

We have two assessments designed for different skill levels. Please select the one for the role you are applying for:

- [Junior Developer Assessment](./docs/JuniorDevAssessment.md)
- [Intermediate Developer Assessment](./docs/IntermediateDevAssessment.md)

## Provided Resources

- [HTML Template](./assets/template.html) — a pre-built Bootstrap page layout to base your views on, with placeholder comments marking where content should be inserted
- [Mock Data](./assets/Blog-Posts.json) — blog post data including content and comments, to be moved into the project and used as your data source

## Use of AI

You are welcome to use AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.) during this assessment.

As you work, keep brief notes on how you used AI — which tools, what you prompted it to do, where it was helpful, and where it fell short. You don't need to produce a formal write-up, but having a short section in your repository's README or a commit history that reflects your process will be useful.

We'll discuss your use of AI in the interview, including:

- Which tools you used and for which parts of the task
- Example prompts you wrote — what worked well and what didn't
- Where the AI output was wrong or unhelpful, and how you identified and corrected it
- Anything you deliberately chose to write yourself rather than use AI for, and why
- Whether AI influenced any structural or architectural decisions — and whether in hindsight you stand behind them

This isn't a test of whether you used AI — it's a way to understand how you work with it. Being honest and reflective will always be viewed positively.
