# .NET Developer Assessment

## Overview

You are tasked with creating a blog post page using the [provided solution](./DeveloperAssessment.sln), which is a slightly modified version of the default ASP.NET Core MVC template targeting .NET 10.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)

## Assessments

We have two assessments designed for different skill levels. Please select the one for the role you are applying for:

- [Junior Developer Assessment](./docs/JuniorDevAssessment.md)
- [Intermediate Developer Assessment](./docs/IntermediateDevAssessment.md)

## Provided Resources

- [HTML Template](./assets/template.html) — a pre-built Bootstrap page layout to base your views on, with placeholder comments marking where content should be inserted
- [Mock Data](./assets/Blog-Posts.json) — blog post data including content and comments, to be moved into the project and used as your data source

## Use of AI

You are welcome to use AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.) during this assessment.

We'll discuss your use of AI in the interview, including which tools you used, what you prompted them to do, where the output was wrong or unhelpful and how you caught it, anything you chose to write yourself and why, and whether AI influenced any structural decisions you'd make differently in hindsight.

This isn't a test of whether you used AI — it's a way to understand how you work with it. Being honest and reflective will always be viewed positively.

## Notes

Please include a `NOTES.md` file in your repository. We've provided a [template](./NOTES.md) to get you started. It doesn't need to be extensive — a few honest sentences per section is all we're looking for.

## Delivery Instructions

Submit your completed solution via a GitHub repository.
