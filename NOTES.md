# Notes

## Time Spent

Roughly how long did you spend on the assessment in total? Were there any exercises where you spent significantly more or less time than you expected, and why?

## Use of AI

Which AI tools did you use, if any, and for which parts of the task? A few things worth noting as you go:

- Prompts that worked well or badly
- Where the output was wrong or unhelpful and how you identified it
- Anything you chose to write yourself rather than use AI for, and why
- Whether AI influenced any structural or architectural decisions — and whether in hindsight you'd stand behind them
